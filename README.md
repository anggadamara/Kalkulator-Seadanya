# Kalkulator-Seadanya

## Introduction
The development of a makeshift calculator serves as an embodiment of a pragmatic approach within the realm of programming science. Originally conceived as a pivotal project for my candidacy as a Lab Assistant at my campus, it has since evolved into a public repository to showcase and document my programming endeavors.

## Project Overview
This repository houses a makeshift calculator project that was meticulously crafted to not only fulfill the requirements for a campus selection process but also to exemplify my dedication and proficiency in software development.

## Features

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
- Clear button to reset the calculator's display.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: The structure of the calculator's user interface.
- CSS: Styling to create a clean and minimalist design.
- JavaScript: Handling user input, calculations, and interactions.
- Golang: Backend server for serving the frontend files.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Go installed.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the repository folder.
4. Run `go run main.go` to start the server.
5. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:8080` to use the calculator.
